This code plots the p-values for the difference between two proportions with unknown variance as a function of sample size. The output is a grid plot (aka faceted plot) showing the p-values for several combinations of sample size and optimized and control group proportions.
The plots are made with GGplot2 in R and lend themselves to a large monitor.
